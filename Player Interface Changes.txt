We would begin by designing a generic Player interface in order to create a version of the Reversi game that supports both manual and AI players. This interface would set out the behaviors and characteristics that are expected for each player, AI or human. Both ManualPlayer and AIPlayer classes are then built from this interface. UsingÂ  a command line, human players could enter their moves with the ManualPlayer class. The AIPlayer class, on the other hand, would use an algorithm to figure out its optimum course of action, like the MinMax with Alpha-Beta pruning (As researched prior)

The main BasicReversi class would be changed to include the Player interface once these player classes have been created. Two instances of the Player interface would be kept in instead of using colors to represent players directly. This would allow the game to support two manual players, two AI players, or a combination of both. In game play, the AI would determine its next move or ask a human for it by calling the relevant method from the current player's class. After that, players would take turns playing the game in a loop until it was over. Finally, the game would be started by a driver or main function, which would instantiate the required player types (AI or Manual) and start the game sequence. This approach not only simplifies the integration of AI and human players, but it also provides flexibility for future improvements, including the addition of graphical user interfaces or more complex AI algorithms.
